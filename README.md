# Healthcare-Associated-Infections

The Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) measures - state data. These measures are developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). They provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. These infections can be related to devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, or spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps.

The metric reported is standardized infection ratios (SIRs). SIRs compare the actual number of Healthcare-Assiocated Infections at each hospital to the predicted number of infections. These ratios are adjusted for various risk factors and population traits.
